    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <p>
      The Harvard College CubeSat will test the utility and viability of Shape-Memory Alloys as a means to reduce cost and complexity for instrumentation in a microgravity environment. The goal is for this application of shape-memory alloys to represent a simple, scalable, and cost-competitive solution for critical deployment functions in Earth orbit and beyond.

      The design was a pyramidal structure holding the antenna at the top. The model was made in Solidworks with 2mm aluminum plates. Each plate was measured, cut, and drilled. There were horizontal beams placed in between the diagonal base plates to provide support to the structure, they were attached through screws. Likewise, the base was joined to the upper structure through MIG welding.

     The antenna was built based upon the requirements offered by the company.

    MIG welding was the technique used for this project over  TIG welding because of its high-quality welds and also the strength of the joint that it generates.
